# Useful tools for a reproducible science

[This course](https://marieetienne.github.io/reproductibilite/_presentation) is a basic introduction of the control versionning system [git](https://git-scm.com/). We will also make use  of the Github plateform.

## Prerequisites

Attending this course requires 

   - a functionnal installation of git, which can be downloaded and installed [following this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (please click on the display on the right portion of the page).
   - a Github account. Be careful, the Github platform is highly noticeable and will provide you with a professional showcase, it can be visited by potential recruiters (so avoid login names such as bogoss, turlutu, toto or anything of that style).

# Bayesian Model for Ecology

This course is open to students from Datascience and MODE.

The slides are available  [here](https://marieetienne.github.io/bayesian_and_ecology/_presentation/#1)

some gentle reminders on classical probability distributions frequently used in Bayesian modelling approaches [here](slides/LoiProbas.pdf)

# All you want to know on linear modelling

As part of the Tropical Forest Ecology Master in Kourou, French Guyana, I teach a 15hours course on linear modelling. Since 2021, online teaching has becomed a potential option (at least it was in 2021 and 2022). Therefore I have recorded my lectures. The whole course (in French) is available on [this page](linearmodel.html)
