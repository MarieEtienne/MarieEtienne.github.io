This website is a first minimal version of my personal website. Everything is expected to go through major changes in the coming months. 

  

  
I'm  assistant Professor in [Agrocampus Ouest](https://www.agrocampus-ouest.fr/) and specialized in the development of statistical methods for ecology.
  




On this website, you will find teaching materials and some information on my research. 

## Research Interests

I am mainly interested in the use of stochastic processes to model and infer biological processes, particularly ecological processes. 

Recently I focused mainly on movement ecology application and the development of statistical methods to extract knowledge from the study of animals, but also fishing vessels movement. 

### Statistical methods

-  **Segmentation**. Developping model to infer underlying activities based on the observation of the movement. This research relies on Hidden Marko Model for movement and change point detection method.


- **Stochastic differential equations**. SDE is an appealing probabilistic object to represent movement because of the continuous time and continuous space formuation of the model and a nice, but probably questionable, MArkov property. 

- Spatial Zero inflated data
