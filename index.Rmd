I am currently Associate Professor at [ENSAI](https://ensai.fr/),  on leave from [Institut Agro Renens Angers](https://www.institut-agro-rennes-angers.fr/)  where I arrived in 2017.

I'm specialized in the development of statistical methods for ecology and I enjoy working with people from different background: statisticians, ecologists, fisheries scientists, ...
You will find more details on the research section.

As Associate Professor, I spend some time at teaching to students and professionnals at different levels and I love that! Please visit the teaching section to find teaching materials as well as useful links. I also teach R and statistics during continuing education sessions.
