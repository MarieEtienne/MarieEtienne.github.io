Teaching statistics involves teaching statistical software. What is the best statistical software to my opinion (and the opinion of thousands of other), of course <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/'> <img src="img/R.jpeg" hspace = "3"  alt="R" width="25px"> </img> </a>. 

A nice IDE is always useful, please consider using   <a href='https://www.rstudio.com/'> <img src="img/Rstudio.jpeg" hspace = "3"  alt="R" width="25px"> </img> </a>


Why is R so great ?

- Because it's reasonnably easy
- Because most new statistical methods are available on R
- Because of active R communnity: many open-source online help and many exmaples
