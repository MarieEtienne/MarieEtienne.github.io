Teaching statistics involves teaching statistical software. There are currently two major option in the free software community: R and/or Python. 

**Don't choose, learn both !!**

# Why is R so great ?

A few years ago, I would have said that  the best statistical software to my opinion (and the opinion of thousands of other) is of course <a href='https://cran.r-project.org/'> <img src="img/R.jpeg" hspace = "3"  alt="R" width="25px"> </img> </a> combined with a nice IDE like <a href='https://www.rstudio.com/'> <img src="img/Rstudio.jpeg" hspace = "3"  alt="R" width="25px"> </img> </a>


- Because it's reasonnably easy
- Because most new statistical methods are available on R
- Because of active R communnity: many open-source online help and many examples

Here are some of my last discoveries or my favorite ones

## About R and RStudio:
- [YaRrr! The Pirateâ€™s Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/)
- [Getting started with R](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/lab/getting_started_with_r)

Some are even in French
- [Prise en main de R et RStudio](http://beginr.u-bordeaux.fr/part1-prise_en_main_R.html)


## About RMarkdown 

- [Introduction to R Markdown](https://m-clark.github.io/Introduction-to-Rmarkdown/)
- [RMarkdown for Scientists](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/)
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)


## R and data science

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


## Some inspiring plots 

- [ggplot graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/portfolio/ggplot2-package/)


Because I'm not so stubborn I acknwoledge that Python is a great option for conducting statistical analysis especially in a statistical learning context. 

# Why is Python also great ?

- Because it's reasonnably easy
- Because most new statistical methods are available on Python
- Because of Jupyter Notebooks

## Developping with Python 

 - A nice Python editor [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
 - Using notebook [The Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org/)
 
 
## Python and data science
